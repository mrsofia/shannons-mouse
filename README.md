This repository contains the design specification and source code for my Shannon's Mouse project.

What is Shannon's Mouse?

Shannon's Mouse is a modern browser-based spin on Claude Shannon's "smart mouse," Theseus. Theseus is an electrical mouse that learns its way around a maze to find a piece of "cheese." Once Theseus discovers the cheese, you can put him back anywhere in the maze and he will immediately find the shortest path back to the cheese. You can even move some of the walls around, and Theseus will still use the information he has already learned in order to speed up the process of finding the cheese.
